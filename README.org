This is my personal online resume.

It is written in Emacs org-mode format and can be converted to other
formats(pdf/html/markdown) via [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc][pandoc]].

You need to have a latest version of [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]] installed to build pdf.

I've also write a Rakefile to automate this workflow:

- =rake pdf=: convert to pdf via [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc][pandoc]] and [[http://www.xelatex.org/][xelatex]].
- =rake tex=: convert to tex source file.

Internals:
- pandoc is amazing.
- pandoc is awesome.
- pandoc(<=1.12.3.2) didn't support org-mode reader, so you must build pandoc
  from master code if you want to convert from org-mode format to other
  formats.
- pandoc support a user-provided header file when you want to convert to
  tex/pdf format.
